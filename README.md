Confidential ML is the practice of training machine learning models without
seeing the training data. It is needed in many enterprises to satisfy the
strict compliance and privacy guarantees they provide to their customers. This
repository contains a set of utilities for confidential ML, with a special
emphasis on using PyTorch in
[Azure Machine Learning pipelines](https://aka.ms/pl-concept).
 
## Using

Compliant logging library see:
[docs/logging](https://github.com/Azure/confidential-ml-utils/blob/master/docs/logging/README.md)

Minimal use case:

```python
from confidential_ml_utils import DataCategory, enable_confidential_logging, prefix_stack_trace
import logging


@prefix_stack_trace(allow_list=["FileNotFoundError", "TypeError"])
def main():
    enable_confidential_logging()

    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    log.info("Hi there", category=DataCategory.PUBLIC)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
